At CIHE, we believe that we are unique.

We pride ourselves on our ethical dealings with students and stakeholders and ensure that every student is treated as an individual. As Dean/CEO, my door is always open to students, whether to discuss their course, personal concerns or simply just to pass the time of day. At our levels of CIHE, students are our number one priority. We are all aware that today's corporate world is a very competitive place and organisations are increasingly seeking employees with ‘the right attitude'. To address this, we focus on the whole individual. Our students are encouraged to develop and demonstrate an attitude that's appealing to prospective employers based on respect for others, honesty, integrity, loyalty and a strong work ethic. These attributes are not only important in our work life but also in our personal life - they help us to be successful individuals.",
